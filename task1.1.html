                    The floppy disk (or a 3 1/2 floppy for today's standard) is a removable magnetic storage medium. 
                    Floppy disks are used for moving information between computers, laptops or other devices. 
                    Some early digital cameras, electronic music instruments and older computer game consoles use floppy disks. 
                    Floppy disks are inserted in to a floppy disk drive or simply floppy drive to allow data to be read or stored.

                <p>The first floppy disks, invented and made by IBM, had a disk diameter of 8 inches (203.2 mm).
                    Subsequently, the 5¼-inch and then the 3½-inch became a ubiquitous form of data storage and transfer into the first years of the 21st century.
                    3½-inch floppy disks can still be used with an external USB floppy disk drive. USB drives for 5¼-inch, 8-inch, and other-size floppy disks are rare to non-existent. 
                    Some individuals and organizations continue to use older equipment to read or transfer data from floppy disks.</p>
                <p>
                    Floppy disks were so common in late 20th-century culture that many electronic and software programs continue to use save icons that look like floppy disks well into the 21st century, 
                    as a form of skeuomorphic design. While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses, especially with legacy industrial computer equipment, 
                    they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater data storage capacity and data transfer speed, such as USB flash drives, 
                    memory cards, optical discs, and storage available through local computer networks and cloud storage.
